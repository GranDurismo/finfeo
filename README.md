# Wetter weekends

This script gets historical weather data for a location (right now Montevideo, Uruguay) by leveraging Dark Sky's API, which allows for 1000 free calls per day. The script allows requests to be saved and reused at a later day in order to circumvent the free API limitation.

Resources exist for historical weather data in Uruguay (see for example [INIA's Banco Agroclim√°tico](http://www.inia.uy/gras/Clima/Banco-datos-agroclimatico/)). However, the goal is obtain comparable data for several locations around the world, which is why I'm using a single source.

Also, after kind of getting something usable, I found out about [this](https://github.com/ZeevG/python-forecast.io) :unamused:.
